1. Prompt user to enter r, p, or s representing rock, paper, or scissors.

2. Computer chooses a random value in a list of r, p, or s.

3. We determine if the user wins or not.

   * If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors then user wins.

   * If user picks rock and if computer picks paper then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.

   * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.

   * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.

   * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.

4. We then add to their score.

   * If user wins then we add one to their wins.
    
   * If user loses then we add one to their losses.
    
   * If user ties then we add one to their ties.

5. Prompt user to play again.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
